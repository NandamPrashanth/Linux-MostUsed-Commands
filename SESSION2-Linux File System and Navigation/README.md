# Session 2 â€“ Linux File System and Navigation

In this session we will learn how What is **File System** , **File System Components** , **Hierarchical Tree Structure in Linux** and commands which we use in day to day life in File System.

And later we will see how to Navigate in between files. And how to **Print Working Directory**, **Change Directory** , **List Directory Contents** , **Special Directory Symbols**, and then we will see scenario based exapmles.

# WHAT IS FILE SYSTEM?

A **File System** is a method used by an Operating System ( **OS**) to organize, store,  retrieve and manage data on storage devices like hard driver's, SSDs and USB drivers.

# FILE SYSTEM COMPONENTS

| Component        | Description                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Files**        | Actual data (documents, executables, logs, etc.)                   |
| **Directories**  | Containers that organize files (like folders in Windows)           |
| **Metadata**     | Information about files (size, creation date, permissions, etc.)   |
| **Mount Points** | Locations in the directory tree where storage devices are attached |
| **Inodes**       | Unique identifiers for each file, storing metadata and location    |


**EXAMPLE** :  Think of a File System like a LIBRARY

* Librarian = Opearting System (organizes and retrieves things for you)
* Library catalog = metadata (tells you where a book is, who wrote it, when it was added)
* Shelves = directories
* Books = files
